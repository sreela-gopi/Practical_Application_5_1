# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
Project Goal:
This assignment is to find out whether a customer will accept a coupon for a restaurent delivered to their phone while driving near the location.
Problem Context:
Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
What are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?
